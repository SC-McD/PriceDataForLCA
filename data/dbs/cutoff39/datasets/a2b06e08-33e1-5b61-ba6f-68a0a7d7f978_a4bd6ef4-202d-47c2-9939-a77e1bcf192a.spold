        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">The dataset describes the production of Portland cement clinker in Brazil. </text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">Clinker is the main constituent of Portland cement and also the main responsible for its environmental impacts. Clinker is made by sintering a mixture composed mainly of limestone and clay (called “raw meal”) at temperatures up to 1450 °C. Both primary and secondary fuels are used to this end. After sintering, clinker nodules have a diameter between 5 mm and 25 mm.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="2">Clinker consists of various calcium silicates including alite (3CaO.SiO2 or “C3S”) and belite (2CaO.SiO2 or “C2S”). Tricalcium aluminate (3CaO.Al2O3 or “C3A”) and calcium aluminoferrite (4CaO.Al2O3.Fe2O3 or “C4AF”) are other common components, added to reduce the sintering temperature of the calcium silicates. For special cement types, such as low heat and sulfate resistant, it is necessary to limit the amount of tricalcium aluminate formed.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="3">Naturally occurring calcareous deposits such as limestone, marl or chalk provide calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and quarries are often close to the cement plant. Clay, shale and sand are the preferred sources for silica. Iron ore and bauxite are the main sources of iron oxide and alumina. Raw materials are mixed at a certain proportion and are milled together in an operation called pre-homogenization, producing the “raw meal”. To ensure high cement quality, the chemistry of the raw materials and of the raw meal is very carefully monitored and controlled.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="4">Portland cement clinker is made by heating the raw meal in a rotary kiln (calcination). As the kiln rotates, the material slides and tumbles down through progressively hotter zones towards the flame. The fuel is fired directly into the end of the kiln. The calcination reaction (CaCO3 → CaO + CO2) emits carbon dioxide into the air, and fuel combustion generates several air emissions. Different types of fuels can be used, including fossil fuels, biomass and wastes. The use of waste fuels in the cement kiln is called “coprocessing”.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="5">Depending on the process configuration, the kiln can be preceded by preheating and/or precalcining steps. Preheating consists of a series of cyclones through which the raw meal is passed, coming in contact with swirling hot kiln exhaust gases moving in the opposite direction. The precalciner is a combustion chamber at the bottom of the preheater, at the entry of the kiln. </text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="6">After the kiln, clinker is cooled and stored in silos. Clinker production plants are usually integrated with cement plants.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="7">Primary data were gathered from six cement manufacturers in Brazil, who informed the total values of inputs and outputs related to clinker production in 2016, considering all their clinker production sites. All types of flows were reported, namely: primary and secondary raw materials and fuels, auxiliary materials, electricity consumption, water consumption and air emissions (from emissions monitoring reports). It corresponds to 70% market share, considered a good representativeness level.</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">According to the GNR database, 49% of the clinker is produced in dry kilns with preheater and precalciner, being the other 51% produced in mixed kiln types (dry). Regarding fuel types, 80,5% are fossil fuels, 10,4% biomass and 9,1% alternative fossil and mixed wastes (data from 2014). According to SNIC (2013), there are 88 cement factories in Brazil. 57 are integrated plants that produce clinker and cement (ABCP, 2016), being 38 of them licensed for coprocessing.</text>

        <samplingProcedure xml:lang="en">Primary data were gathered from six cement manufacturers in Brazil, who informed the total values of inputs and outputs related to clinker production in 2016, considering all their clinker production sites. All types of flows were reported, namely: primary and secondary raw materials and fuels, auxiliary materials, electricity consumption, water consumption and air emissions (from emissions monitoring reports). It corresponds to 70% market share, considered a good representativeness level.
For all flows, the weighted average of each manufacturer"s unit flows was calculated, considering its clinker production volume as the weighing factor. The types of raw materials and fuels vary between manufacturers, which explains the high basic uncertainty for some flows, as this dataset represents the average clinker production for Brazil. Basic uncertainty was calculated based on the sample"s weighted standard deviation.
Water consumption was usually reported for the whole integrated cement plants (clinker + cement production operations). Based on literature and expert opinion, the total water volume was divided equally between the clinker and the cement production processes. Raw materials and fuel inputs were considered to be dry. As water is mainly used for cooling, it was considered that all water evaporates, except for the "tap water" input, which was considered to be used as drinking water and whose output is modelled as an effluent.
Fuel consumption was informed by manufacturers in terms of volume or mass. CO2 emissions (both fossil and biogenic) were calculated from fuel inputs. As CO2 emission factors are expressed in terms of energy (kg/GJ), fuel consumption was converted into energy by multiplying them to the corresponding lower heating values. Both the CO2 emission factors and heating values are informed in the "exchange properties" field. 
Other air emissions are the weighted average of the manufacturers who informed them. Not all manufacturers reported all air emissions and the weighted average was adjusted accordingly (only considering the ones who informed each flow).
Some specific information was extrapolated from "clinker production/CH" dataset (accessed 28.02.2018): proportion between refractory types; proportion between particulate size classes and the infrastructure flow "industrial machine, heavy, unspecified".
The amounts of the exchanges were calculated considering the weighted average of the sample. No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other ecoinvent datasets.
