        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">The process represents the treatment of a waste (sewage sludge) that is exclusively generated from another waste treatment. Sewage sludge is generated in the wastewater treatment of 'rainwater mineral oil storage'. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for 'rainwater mineral oil storage'. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 0%. Landfill gas capture and utilisation generates 0.03321 kWh of electricity and 0.0599 MJ of useful heat. 0.002598 kg waste mass remains in the landfill even after the long term period.</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">Sanitary (controlled) landfill for municipal solid waste. Ultimate average landfill height is 20 meters. Operation phase duration is 30 years. The total raw landfill gas mass produced in the landfill from this waste is 0.09443 kg. The total CH4 mass in the raw landfill gas is 0.03762 kg. Percentage of landfill gas directly emitted is 47w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and flared is 18.02w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and utilised is 34.98%. Conversion efficiencies are 27.8e% for electricity and 13.5e% for useful heat. Leachate generated during the first 100 years is collected and treated region-specifically before emission. Based on average waste composition and climate data the end of carbonate phase is estimated to be reached 4'389 years after waste deposition.</text>
