It includes the whole manufacturing process to produce clinker (raw material provision, grinding and mixing; rotary kiln process), internal processes (transport, etc.) and for the infrastructure only the rotary kiln (material consumption) is taken into account. No administration is included. Waste (as secondary fuel and raw material) enter the system without environmental burdens from upstream processes.</includedActivitiesEnd>
