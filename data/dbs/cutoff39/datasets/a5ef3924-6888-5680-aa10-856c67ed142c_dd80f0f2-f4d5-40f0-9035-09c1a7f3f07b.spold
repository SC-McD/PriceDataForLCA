Expenditures from treatment of wastewater in waste treatment plant are included as well as relevant infrastructure of the plant. Emissions from any sludge digestion, biogas generation and utilization (heeding specific wastewater composition) are also included. Waste-specific direct emissions of untreated wastewater and required territory-specific infrastructure for sewers are not contained within this dataset but instead in the regional market datasets for this wastewater.</includedActivitiesEnd>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">This dataset represents the treatment of a wastewater, generated from an ordinary transforming activity. Purification in wastewater treatment of 'wastewater from hard fibreboard production'. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used for wastewaters, generated from ordinary transforming activities, of equal or similar composition. The wastewater has a content of TOC: 0.14375 kg/m3, COD: 0.56043 kg/m3 and BOD: 0.27105 kg/m3. TOC is equal to C present in the wastewater, COD is calculated as TOC/0.2565 and BOD is calculated as COD/0.53034. Detailed elemental composition can be found in the properties of the wastewater treated. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 99.99%.</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">This is an inventory for the disposal of a selected wastewater in Europe. The reference unit is 1 m3 wastewater input. This activity represents the treatment of a specific wastewater in a WWT plant (while direct emissions and sewering are heeded in the upstream market dataset for this wastewater). The size of the treatment plant infrastructure is for a supranational region average territory situation. The assumed size of the WWTP treats 99.2 Mio m3 per year. The mixture of WWTP with one, two, or three stages is 1.89%-22.8%-75.3%. The actual, waste-specific oxygen requirement in the biological stages is 0.1200408 kg O. The digestion process produces 59.148384 litres of biogas with an energy content of 1.3615336MJ. 74.6% of the biogas is utilized for energy. The remainder is flared. The gross electric efficiency is 26.564%. The gross thermal efficiency is 47.853%. After digestion, the remaining total sludge mass (dry matter) is 0.1456kg DM.</text>
