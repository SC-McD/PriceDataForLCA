          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">The process represents the treatment of a waste (sewage sludge) that is exclusively produced from another waste treatment. Municipal incineration is the controlled combustion of a waste. Sewage sludge is generated in the wastewater treatment of 'wastewater, average'. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for 'wastewater, average'. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 97.44%.</text>
