        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">The dataset describes the production of portland cement clinker; in the production different types of alterantive fuels and raw materials are used. As the use of a alternative fuel/material can vary considerably between different years, this dataset covers the period from 2005 to 2009.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">Clinker consists of various calcium silicates including alite and belite. Tricalcium aluminate and calcium aluminoferrite are other common components. These components are often generated in situ by heating various clays and limestone.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="2">None</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="3">Portland cement clinker is made by heating in a rotary kiln at high temperature a homogeneous mixture of raw materials. The products of the chemical reaction aggregate together at their sintering temperature, about 1,450 Â°C. Aluminium oxide and iron oxide are present only as a flux to reduce the sintering temperature and contribute little to the cement strength. For special cements, such as low heat (LH) and sulfate resistant (SR) types, it is necessary to limit the amount of tricalcium aluminate formed. The major raw material for the clinker-making is usually limestone mixed with a second material containing clay as source of alumino-silicate. Normally, an impure limestone which contains clay or silicon dioxide (SiO2) is used. The calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content of these limestones can be as low as 80%. Second raw materials (materials in the rawmix other than limestone) depend on the purity of the limestone. Some of the second raw materials used are: clay, shale, sand, iron ore, and bauxite. </text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="4">The CO2 emissions from the use of alternative fuels as well as CO2 emissions from the calcination of limestone have been included in the environmental flows of fossil/non-fossil CO2 emissions. For calculations for clinker, cement and concrete that do not follow this methodological approach, recalculations have to be made adjusting the respective elementary flows in this dataset.</text>

- Consider if it would be better to create this dataset as a child dataset relative to a parent dataset. See the ecoinvent Data Quality Guideline Chapter 4.2 for further advice.
- Could not calculate balance. Found a carbon content property without corresponding dry mass property. Please add a dry mass property to the following exchange:
used tyre
- Property 'wet mass=1' of master data exchange was removed from exchange 'used tyre'.
Property 'dry mass=1' of master data exchange was removed from exchange 'used tyre'.
Amount of property 'carbon content, non-fossil=0,193' of exchange 'used tyre' deviates from the default amount in the master file.
Property 'water in wet mass=0' of master data exchange was removed from exchange 'used tyre'.
Property 'water content=0' of master data exchange was removed from exchange 'used tyre'.
