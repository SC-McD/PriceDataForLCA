          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">This dataset represents the treatment of a wastewater, generated from an ordinary transforming activity. Purification in wastewater treatment of 'wastewater, average'. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used for wastewaters, generated from ordinary transforming activities, of equal or similar composition. The wastewater has a content of TOC: 0.1091 kg/m3, COD: 0.42534 kg/m3 and BOD: 0.20572 kg/m3. TOC is equal to C present in the wastewater, COD is calculated as TOC/0.2565 and BOD is calculated as COD/0.53034. Detailed elemental composition can be found in the properties of the wastewater treated. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 99.98%.</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">This is an inventory for the disposal of a selected wastewater in Europe without Switzerland. The reference unit is 1 m3 wastewater input. This activity represents the treatment of a specific wastewater in a WWT plant (while direct emissions and sewering are heeded in the upstream market dataset for this wastewater). The size of the treatment plant infrastructure is for a supranational region average territory situation. The assumed size of the WWTP treats 99.2 Mio m3 per year. The mixture of WWTP with one, two, or three stages is 1.89%-22.8%-75.3%. The actual, waste-specific oxygen requirement in the biological stages is0.14380624 kg O. The digestion process produces 49.664032 litres of biogas with an energy content of 1.065704MJ. 74.6% of the biogas is utilized for energy. The remainder is flared. The gross electric efficiency is 26.564%. The gross thermal efficiency is 47.853%. After digestion, the remaining total sludge mass (dry matter) is 0.1763kg DM.</text>
