          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">The process represents the treatment of a waste (sewage sludge) that is exclusively produced from another waste treatment. Municipal incineration is the controlled combustion of a waste. Sewage sludge is generated in the wastewater treatment of 'wastewater from potato starch production'. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for 'wastewater from potato starch production'. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 98.919%.</text>

Auxiliary material consumption for this step of air pollution control (APC) are included in the process. Infrastructure is also included in the process. Air polution control includes, electrostatic precipitator for fly ash (ESP), wet flue gas scrubber and 25% SNCR , 42.77% SCR-high dust , 32.68% SCR-low dust -DeNOx facilities and 0% without DeNOx (weighted according to mass of burnt waste). Efficiency of iron scrap separation from slag : 58%. Efficiency of aluminium scrap separation from slag : 31%. Efficiency of copper scrap separation from slag : 31%. The technology mix for this dataset includes a filter ash treatment (FLUWA) of a share of 46.22%.
