        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">The treatment of non-Fe-Co-metals fraction from used Li-ion battery, pyrometallurgical processing is based on the proxy "treatment of precious metal from electronics scrap, in anode slime, precious metal extraction". This proxy has been chosen because of the diverse composition of this fraction. The byproducts in the original dataset "silver, secondary, at precious metal refinery", "gold, secondary, at precious metal refinery" and "palladium, secondary, at precious metal refinery" have been deleted in order to adapt the dataset to the composition of the non-Fe-Co-metals fraction. The same has been done for the original outputs of Cadmium, Lead, Mercury and Zinc. The composition of the non-Fe-Cp-metals is 21% Copper, 14.4% Aluminium and 0.8% Lithium. The composition is calculated from the Li-Ion battery production, including cathode and anode components.The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly. </text>
