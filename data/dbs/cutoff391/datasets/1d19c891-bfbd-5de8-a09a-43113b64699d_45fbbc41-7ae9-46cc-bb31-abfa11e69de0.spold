- The following negative reference products could not be identified as materials for treatment. No activities exist that produce these materials for treatment.
 - waste polyvinylfluoride

- Production volume of local datasets for a specific activity, time period, and macro-economic scenario must not exceed production volume of the corresponding global.

 -  Exchange 'zinc concentrate', global (2006-2012) production volume 73260, sum of all non-global production volumes 73260. Local datasets used in calculation: CH (2006-2012) PV: 73260
 -  Exchange 'electricity, for reuse in municipal waste incineration only', global (2006-2012) production volume 1960400, sum of all non-global production volumes 1960400. Local datasets used in calculation: CH (2006-2012) PV: 1960400
