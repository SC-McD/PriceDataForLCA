        <comment xml:lang="en">Calculated value. Information was provided for the total energy consumption for clinker production for Colombia in 2012. The information is based on statistics of all Colombian producers in TJ (terajoules). The clinker production in 2012 was 8.7 Mt (Ministerio de Minas y Energia, 2017). According to ASOCRETO five percent of the energy was provided by secondary fuels. Since the share of the different secondary fuels is not provided we’ve used the weighted average of the data published by Argos, Holcim and Cemex, which represents 81% of the market share. The LHV are taken from  (Dauriat et al., 2014)

        <samplingProcedure xml:lang="en">The data is compiled based on different data sources, including sustainability reports, literature values and expert judgements. Most data is derived from sustainability reports of the three principal clinker producers of Colombia (Argos, Cemex and Holcim). The data is checked, completed and validated by local experts. In total, it is estimated that the data considered is representative for 81% of clinker production in all the country (market share of the three main clinker producers).
Unit flows were calculated by dividing the amounts of inputs and outputs by the total clinker production in mass.
The amount of the exchanges were calculated considering the arithmetic/weighted average of the sample. No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other Ecoinvent datasets.</samplingProcedure>
        <extrapolations xml:lang="en">The life cycle inventory model is based on the PCR for cement and concrete(Environdec, 2010), as well as on the LCA core model of the WBCSD-CSI EPD tool (Dauriat et al., 2014). 
Air emissions (expect CO2, NOx and SO2) are modelled on literature values (Dauriat et al., 2014). The infrastructure, auxiliary materials, wastes are based on the global ecoinvent dataset for clinker production.

Standard basic uncertainty values were used.

- Specified amount (2,28E-07) did not match amount calculated by uncertainty (2,31E-05) at exchange "Benzo(a)pyrene"
- The total water in wet mass of all input exchanges (0,973752040698674) and output exchanges (1,0233680855) is unbalanced.

- Uncertainty shall always be provided for all primary data inputs (exchange amounts, properties and parameters), except for the amount and properties of reference products.
