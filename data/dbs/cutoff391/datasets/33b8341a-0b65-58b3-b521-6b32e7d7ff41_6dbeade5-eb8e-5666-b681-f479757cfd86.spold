        <includedActivitiesStart xml:lang="en">The activity starts with the waste being available for landfarming. Collection and transportation of the waste to this process is not included.</includedActivitiesStart>
        <includedActivitiesEnd xml:lang="en">The activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the landfarming process are released to the environment (air, water and soil). The activity is considering local fate of emissions and the initial specific wastewater composition (generating the sewage sludge). Further, it includes provision of fertiliser functions for N, P, K, if present in the sludge.</includedActivitiesEnd>
        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">The process represents the treatment of a waste (sewage sludge) that is exclusively produced from another waste treatment. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for 'wastewater, average'. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 97.59%.</text>
