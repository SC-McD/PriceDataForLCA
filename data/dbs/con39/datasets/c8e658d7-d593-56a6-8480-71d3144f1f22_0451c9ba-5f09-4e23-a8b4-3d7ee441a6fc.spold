        <includedActivitiesEnd xml:lang="en">This activity ends with the cooling of the produced clinker. It includes the whole manufacturing process to produce clinker (raw material provision, grinding and mixing; rotary kiln process), internal processes (transport, etc.) and for the infrastructure only the rotary kiln (material consumption) is taken into account. No administration is included. Waste (as secondary fuel and raw material) enter the system without environmental burdens from upstream processes. </includedActivitiesEnd>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">The dataset describes the production of portland cement clinker; in the production different types of alterantive fuels and raw materials are used. As the use of a alternative fuel/material can vary considerably between different years, this dataset covers the period from 2005 to 2009.</text>
