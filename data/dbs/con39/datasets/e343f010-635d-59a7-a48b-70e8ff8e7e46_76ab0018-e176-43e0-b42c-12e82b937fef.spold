        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">This dataset represents the production of ready-mix concrete in Austria, with 25MPa compressive strength at 28 days, exposure class XC1. Ingredients for 1m3 of fresh concrete are: Cement 241 kg, Water 177 kg, Sand 932 kg, Gravel 1022 kg, chemical admixtures 1.55 kg, supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) 46 kg. The SCM content refers to AHWZ = aufbereitete hydraulisch wirksame Zusatzstoffe: which are processed hydraulic additions for concrete production, consisting of specially processed fly-ash with slag and limestone powder, according to Austrian standard Ã–NORM B 3309. 25 MPa concrete is intended for building structures in general, exposed to freeze-thaw, including residential, commercial and industrial uses. According to the european standard EN 206-1, XC exposure classes refer to the risk of "corrosion induced by carbonation" (see Table 1 excerpt below). The XC1 class represents, more specifically, a concrete in a dry or permanently wet environment, such as concrete in a building with low air humidity or concrete permanently submerged in water, respectively. The concrete mix documented here is an average of seven concrete manufacturers which, together, represent approximately 90% of ready-mix concrete production in Austria. Exchange properties are declared for the fresh concrete. Concrete dry mass considers the amount of water that reacts with cement to form hydrates. As a consequence, this dataset is not water balanced according to ecoinvent guidelines. The waste generated in production has been accounted for, and the amount of additional inputs was proportionately split up between concrete ingredients, except for inputs of auxiliary materials, such as lubricating oil and rubber. The annual production volume and proportion per strength class data was provided by the Austrian Association for ready mix concrete manufacturers for the year 2018. Distribution by ready-mix exposure classes in Austria is: XC1-19.7%; XC2-23.6%; B1-10.3%; B2-21.5%. Other types of concrete (i.e. exposed to different environments) represent, together,  24.9% and we're not modelled here due to their inexpressive individual consumption.</text>

For other auxiliary flows, data was taken from the largest concrete manufacturer in Austria. Basic uncertainty was calculated from the coefficient of variation of the sample. No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other ecoinvent datasets.
Representativeness is of 24.14% based on the annual production volumes of XC1 concrete provided by the seven concrete manufacturers against the annual production volume of XC1 concrete for the country provided by the Austrian association of ready-mix concrete manufacturers</samplingProcedure>
