          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">This dataset describes the steel production for reinforcing steel in Austria from secondary steel (iron scrap) in an electric arc furnace. The iron scrap is melted in the electric arc furnace and alloys are added. After the melting process in the furnace, the steel is cast into billets. The billets can then be hot rolled and used as reinforcing steel in construction. The hot rolling is not included in this dataset.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">There are three co-products that are used in other industries: Slag is sold as material in road construction. Scale (material formed through oxidation of the cooling billet) can be used in steel production, cement production, and refractory production. Heat is used in the communal district heating grid.</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">The electric arc furnace production route of reinforcing steel starts with the arrival of iron scrap in the steel factory. The iron scrap is melted in the electric arc furnace and alloys (approximately 1% manganese (Mn), 0.2% silicon (Si) and in some cases microalloy (for example 0.01% vanadium (V)). After the melting process in the furnace, the steel is cast into billets. These billets are processed by hot rolling into rebars and coils for reinforcing steel. Rebars have a diameter of 8-40mm and a length of 6-30m. Coils have a diameter of 8-16mm and weigh 1.7, 3.0 or 5.0. The average steel grade is B550 or B500 (550 or 500 MPa).</text>

For the year 2017, the input material flows were given in absolute numbers and per tonne of produced steel. Emission data were measured in the factory's dust separation unit and extrapolated to emissions per year and per tonne of steel. CO2-emissions were calculated separately based on carbon bearing inputs. The CO2-calculation was approved by the Technical Inspection Agency (TÜV) and used as a basis for emission trading.</samplingProcedure>
        <extrapolations xml:lang="en">The emissions to air were extrapolated from three measurements to cover the whole year 2017. 
In case the company did not provide accurate data, data from the dataset "steel production, electric, low-alloyed [RER]" were used.</extrapolations>
